## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **HTML5** → structure  
- **CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)** → styling and responsive layouts  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** → dynamic content and interactivity   

---

## 📖 How It Works  
1. All recipes are stored in a **JavaScript array of objects** (`recipes.js`).  
2. JavaScript dynamically generates recipe cards on the webpage.  
3. Users can browse recipes by **category, search, or scroll**.  
4. Fully responsive layout adapts to **mobile, tablet, and desktop**.  

---

## 🌱 Future Scope  
- Add **backend with database** (Node.js + MongoDB / MySQL) to store recipes dynamically  
- Allow users to **submit their own recipes** via form  
- Add **multilingual support** (Konkani, Portuguese)  
- Enhance with **animations** and **progressive web app (PWA)** features
