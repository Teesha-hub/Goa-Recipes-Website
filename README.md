Users can browse recipes by category, search, or scroll.

Fully responsive layout adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop.

🌱 Future Scope

Add backend with database (Node.js + MongoDB / MySQL) to store recipes dynamically.

Allow users to submit their own recipes via form.

Add multilingual support (Konkani, Portuguese).

Enhance with animations and progressive web app (PWA) features.
